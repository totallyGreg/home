Dear .Mac trial member, 

Your .Mac account will expire on September 30, 2002. If you
don't sign up for full membership, which you can still do at
the special former iTools member price of US$49.95, that is the
last day you'll be able access your Mac.com Email account,
home pages and iDisk. 

We hope you won't let that happen. .Mac comes with improved
versions of what was already great about iTools, like first-
rate, web-accessible, ISP-independent Mac.com Email, and tight
integration between iPhoto and HomePage publishing. It also
delivers important new features like McAfee's Virex virus
protection software, Backup software from Apple, and calendar
publishing from iCal.  And continual improvement is built into
its DNA. 

The future of power and convenience through connected computing
is bright, and .Mac is leading the way--just ask the more than
100,000 members who've already signed up. At only US$49.95 for the
first year, the price is amazingly low and the value of the
benefits is already remarkably high and heading higher. Join us
today.

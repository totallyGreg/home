PipeLocate: find a file with locate
===================================

Type a file name in Input field and hit Run with argument(s) if necessary.

arguments: [-b|-e|-s|-r|-R] [-c] [-h]
	-b  begins with
	-e  ends with
	-s  is/strict
	-r  regular expression (base name)
	-R  regular expression (any match)
	-c	case sensitive
	-h	show this help

Only the results matching in their last component of path (base name) will be displayed except when -R is specified.

Both Input and Output encodings should be set to UTF-8.

This script assumes you have a recent version of GNU findutils installed manually or via Fink.

If they are not found, the script uses /usr/bin/locate which however does not support ignore case nor non-ASCII characters.

Only /usr/local/bin/locate and /sw/bin/locate are checked by default. If your locate is elsewhere, modify the script accordingly.

Regular expression you can use with -r or -R is not that of perl but that of grep. So non-ASCII characters in a set [   ] will not be interpreted correctly.
